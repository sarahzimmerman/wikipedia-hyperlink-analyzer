# Goals
As a team, we managed to complete our goals of creating a graph using the SNAP Wikispeedia data set and using this data to complete a BFS Traversal, perform Kosaraju’s algorithm, and Brandes’ algorithm for betweenness centrality. 

# Results
Our graph data structure was stored in an adjacency list that we created. We chose to use an adjacency list because we wanted to access all the edges in our algorithms. This would be faster if we used an adjacency list as opposed to a matrix. 

In our BFS traversal, we ran into difficulties in how we wanted to structure it. Due to our data being disconnected, performing a simple BFS traversal at a given node would not allow our algorithm to reach all nodes in the graph. To account for the disconnected components, we created a modified BFS algorithm that performs a BFS on a starting node, then continues to perform it for every node until all nodes have been discovered. 

In our betweenness centrality algorithm, we used Brandes’ algorithm. This meant we performed the shortest path on every pair of nodes in our dataset. Following this, we found how many instances of each node appeared in the vector of shortest paths that we found. Finally, we normalized our data to get a range between 0 and 1 for all of our betweenness scores. One thing that we were unable to do is figure out all shortest paths for a given pair of nodes. This caused our betweenness centrality values to be closer to an estimation than the true result. 

In Kosaraju’s algorithm, we had to perform a DFS traversal on our data, reverse our adjacency list, and then perform DFS on the reversed list. This algorithm faced small issues but our final result works as intended. 

With the two algorithms that we conducted, we found many discoveries that allow us to perform better at the game. Using our betweenness algorithm, we were able to find which articles are found most often in a shortest path. We found that the most commonly passed through node was Africa, followed by the United States and England. This result showed us that geographical location is extremely important in our game. Following locations, the next most common topic was the 19th century and other time periods. Below that were species like humans, animals, and birds. Something else interesting we found was that Albert Einstein had the highest score of any individual. We believe that this algorithm defines an optimal strategy of prioritizing location and time period in order to reach your desired destination as fast as possible.

Our second algorithm, Kosaraju’s, showed us which components are strongly connected. This means that every node in the component is able to reach every other node in the component. This algorithm showed us some interesting details about our dataset. While some of our components had a couple nodes in them, almost 4000 nodes were strongly connected with each other (Component #509). This component had thousands of topics ranging from Dinosaurs to fictional characters. This result shows how deeply connected a majority of our data is and how it is possible to reach a majority of nodes from any given node. While it doesn’t provide a strategy we can use, we can see that there is commonly a path even if the two articles are wildly unrelated.
