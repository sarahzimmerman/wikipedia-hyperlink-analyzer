# CS 225 Data Structures

## Team Contract *(gagan2-sarahrz2-sanjivi2-ritvikg2)*

### Communication

### 1. **Meetings** 

Our team will meet once per week at our apartment every Tuesday between 12 pm and 2 pm. We will be using a digital scrumboard on Trello to keep track of our progress throughout the project. We will be keeping a simplified version of the devlog on git. Each meeting will be led by a different team member, decided on a rotational basis starting with Gagan.

### 2. **Assistance**

Each team member can be reached in person, through text  or through email (netid@illinois.edu). We will respond to any message or email within 48 hours barring any emergencies.

### 3. **Respect**

Each week, the team leader will be given the utmost respect in every way. Their role is to ensure that the team is on track to reach its goals for the week and for the semester.


### Collaboration

### 1.  **Work Distribution**

Each week, the tasks will be determined by the whole team. The distribution of tasks will also be decided by the whole team based on each member's preferences and strengths. 

### 2. **Time Committment**

We will dedicate at least 2 hours and at most 5 hours a week on the project. If there is not enough time to finish a task, the rest of the team will be called in to help with the unforeseen problem.

### 3. **Conflict Resolution**

All conflicts in the group will be resolved by a game of Wiki Races. The winner gets to decide who wins in the argument. The loser will have to do the dishes for the rest of the week.
