# Weekly Progress Log

## November 21-28
Our final project proposal was approved on November 27th and we began implementing the classes we need as well as parsing our dataset. We created and used a Python script to format our dataset into a simpler format and saved it to a txt file. We then used that txt file to create an adjacency list for our graph. We also created our Makefile to be able to compile and run our createAdjacencyList method in main.cpp. After testing the function in the terminal, we found that out function creates an adjaceny list correctly for our graph. We will begin working on the BFS traversal method and aim to finish that fairly quickly so that we can begin work on the Kosaraju function.

## November 29 - December 5
We finished implementing both our BFS traversal function and Kosaraju's algorithm. Our goal for this final week is to finish our last algorithm and begin creating a more sophisticated test suite, rather than just testing our methods in main.cpp. After completing the test suite, we will begin cleaning up and finalizing our codebase as well as prepping our presentation/report materials.

## December 6 - 13
We fixed some issues we found in Kosaraju's algorithm and implemented the betweenness centrality algorithm. We then documented and cleaned up all of our code for our final submission. We also finished our final report and recorded our final presentation, as well as finished our test suite. Also, our main.cpp file is able to take in user CLI input.
